1.Issue:the divLogs is connected to one divlog so when slots are removed others the divLogs the first divlog is brought ot zero. And since its a child it will only map one slot
the removing and adding of slotsis based of the mapping of the divlogOne. which shows the other slots but only problem when deleting

solution #1 create 3 seperate files for each divLog return
solution #2 use classes and polymorph

To do:
1.attach the progress bar to the the logs progressbar
2. Connect the total amount of calories to the progresbars
3. create a goals page with macros on the left and right total calories withe circle progress Selector



2.Creating a daily view chart. A bar chart of the macros and a pie chart with percentages on the right .do i want the charts to get it fron the json or to get it from the backend?

3. Have to create models of the data i want saved in the djanog backend/ i have to brush up on how it request info based on that user.data. 

4. Can you have a context api a folder that all the shared context are and have it send out specified infromation thats called. choosing the context you what

5.get protein/fat/carb data from the searchFood api and enter it into the object share context variable 


 6. its not deleting from the array and its only updateing on the add arr 

CURRENT 7. added total calories on first load  

it has a local array that intakes from backend
and it sends to backend when a new one is added
then takes it from backend same time

then takes all full array from back end and adds it for 

8.  make sures it loads current day id on load and the current food array on load

error: it addes into backend array the foods from other dates, there is going to have to be a cleanup.
error: do i need it to get after every create or is using a local arrayenough
first option is easiest

have the total array add up when the creation of the food happens in the searchFood component
