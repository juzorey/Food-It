1.Issue:the divLogs is connected to one divlog so when slots are removed others the divLogs the first divlog is brought ot zero. And since its a child it will only map one slot
the removing and adding of slotsis based of the mapping of the divlogOne. which shows the other slots but only problem when deleting

solution #1 create 3 seperate files for each divLog return
solution #2 use classes and polymorph

To do:
1.attach the progress bar to the the logs progressbar
2. Connect the total amount of calories to the progresbars
3. create a goals page with macros on the left and right total calories withe circle progress Selector
